# Experimental Reproduction

All you need to do is run final.py. Depends on JSON files which are committed in this directory.

The filter_*.py scripts generate the JSON files. They require the 14 GB resolver scan dataset (available at https://securepki.org/sec17.html) in a relative ../../data/dnssec-resolver.lz4 location to run.

The baseline.py was just an early baseline test we used for the intermediate report.
